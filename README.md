## About Cleaneatz 
https://cleaneatz.com/
Clean Eatz, which launched in 2011 and started franchising in 2015, was co-founded by husband-and-wife duo Don and Evonne Varady. We are heart-driven to Change Livez through clean, balanced food, thought-provoking education and motivational support that inspires results. We know personal wellness is not one-size-fits-all, so we craft nutritional products and fitness opportunities that meet the needs of every type of lifestyle.

This is our rally point – our unified focus. Success will come if we put every ounce of energy into people over earnings. Helping others on their healthy lifestyle journey defines our existence…everything else is just the result of that commitment.


## Development
This was built with Laravel as server-side framework, Vue as a client-size framework.
We implemented pixel-perfect design using frontend opensource set such as bootstrap, Jquery, Css and so on to deliver the user-friendly interface so that people can be attracted and casually visited the website.
We tried to do what is the best for our customers in terms of interface: relaxable, convenient, high-quality picture and nice mixture of neat text and images in harmony.
